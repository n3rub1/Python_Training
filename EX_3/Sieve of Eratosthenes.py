# This Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method of giving a list of all the prime numbers
# up to a given number. You start by writing out all the numbers between 2 and
# n. You cross out all of the multiples of 2 (but not 2 itself). Then you cross out
# all of the multiples of 3 (but not 3 itself). And you carry on like that until you
# removed multiples of all numbers up to âˆš
# n. What is left not crossed out is
# precisely the set of prime numbers up to n.
# Try this by hand with n  25.
# Write a program which implements this algorithm. Use it to list all the prime
# numbers up to 10, 000, and to state how many there are.
